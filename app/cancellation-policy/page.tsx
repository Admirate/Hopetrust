                  Therapy helps in making one open his or her awareness. We at Hope Trust, understand that therapies
                  can be challenging especially for those who are not willing to open up. Uncomfortable feelings are
                  normal and are part of the process.

                <p>
                  These frustrations and discomforts will be lessened as the therapy progress and patients shall have
                  a better positive outlook in managing his or her emotions.
